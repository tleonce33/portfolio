# Data Modeling Project

This data modeling project an ERD diagram was created for a 3NF normalized database to use for project purposes.

## Overview

This database is for a case management application database, it was initially designed for training purposes and for practice in using Python Faker library to generate dummy data to use to populate this database.


## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you perform the following steps:

- Restore the sample database backup: PROJECTDB.bak to a SQL Server database engine.
- Use the Python jupyter notebook file to generate dummy data files: Generate Dummy Data.ipynb

## How to Run This Project

1. Open SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio)
2. Connect to the PROJECTDB database.
3. Open the script: PROJECTDB - Table Creation - Case Information
4. Run the script to create the tables.
5. Use the files generated by Python to load data into the tables.

## Lessons Learned

It's been a while since I modeled a database from scratch, so this was a fun little project to dust off my knowledge of normalized / de-normalized database design. It also let me practice my Python skills leveraging the Faker library to generate dummy data to use to populate the database.  It can probably be better, but I think it's a good first attempt.
