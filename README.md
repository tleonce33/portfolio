## Lessons Learned

As I am completing a Masters in Data Science and getting more exposure to new tools and languages, such as Python and R, it's been a a fun challenge to explore and incorporate new learning into old habits. It's helping to bridge the gaps in my knowledge of areas I would like to learn more about, such as data science, machine learning, and data engineering.
