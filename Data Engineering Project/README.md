This data engineering project showcases a data pipeline in AWS including ingestion, transformation, and visualization.

## Overview

This data pipeline was built in an AWS environment leveraging AWS Lambda Functions, Amazon Kinesis Data Firehouse, and S2 buckets for data ingestion, AWS Glue, AWS Athena for data transformation, and Grafana for data visualization. This project will use AWS Free Tier and the charges will be dependent upon the amount of data moving through the pipeline, but should be minimal (under $10/month). The AWS Glue jobs and Lambda functions were coded in Python.

## Lessons Learned

This is my first data engineering project and learning about AWS Cloud. It was a very interesting and new experience that I enjoyed and I was able to learn about the free tier services to build a data pipeline at little to no cost.
