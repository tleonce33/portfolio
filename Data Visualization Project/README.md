## Overview

The sample file provided is on Regional Sales data that was analyzed and produced a dashboard and storyboard. Provided is the image of the Executive Dashboard that was created and the storyboard. The Tableau Desktop file was not published publicly as this is proprietary for the course, but if you would like a copy of the Tableau (twb) file, then please let me know.

## Lessons Learned

I truly enjoyed this course as it followed the "Storytelling with Data" book by Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic as well as the "The Tableau Workshop: A practical guide to the art of data visualization with Tableau" book by Sumit Gupta, Sylvester Pinto, and Shweta Sankhe-Savale. It was a fun course and learning how to apply the techniques of storytelling with data in Tableau.
